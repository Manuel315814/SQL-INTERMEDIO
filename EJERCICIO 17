***This is the same question as problem #3 in the SQL Chapter of Ace the Data Science Interview! Assume you're given the table on user viewershipcategorised by device type where the three types are laptop, tablet, and phone.
Write a query that calculates the total viewership for laptops and mobile devices where mobile is defined as the sum of tablet and phone viewership. Output the total viewership for laptops as laptop_reviews and the total viewership 
for mobile devices as mobile_views. Effective 15 April 2023, the solution has been updated with a more concise and easy-to-understand approach.***

SELECT
    SUM(CASE WHEN device_type = 'laptop' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS laptop_reviews,
    SUM(CASE WHEN device_type IN ('tablet', 'phone') THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS mobile_views
FROM viewership;
